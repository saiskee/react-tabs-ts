# react-tabs-ts

This repository was created to create a simple React tabs component from scracth using Bootstrap.
We will first set up our workspace, configure some dev-tools and plumbing and finally get down to business.

This repository will use the next tools:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Runtime environment.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Client side language that compiles to JavaScript.
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) - JavaScript library for building UIs
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - HTML/JS/CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) - Scripting language that extends CSS.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) - Tool for bundling application source code.
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) - JavaScript test runner.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) - Feature-rich JavaScript test framework.
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com) - BDD / TDD assertion library.

It is grouped by folders, each with its own purpose. The structure is as follows:

## 00 Boilerplate

I this folder we'll explain how to set up  step by step the environment. We'll configure some tools like
webpack for bundling, transpiling TypeScript files, automatic build generation...
 for running our tabs component tests, etc...
